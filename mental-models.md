# Mental Models

From Gabriel Weinberg's Medium article, [Mental Models I Find Repeatedly Useful](https://medium.com/@yegg/mental-models-i-find-repeatedly-useful-936f1cc405d)

The numbers next to each mental model reflect the frequency with which they come up:

* (1) — Frequently (68 models)
* (2) — Occasionally (51 models)
* (3) — Rarely, though still repeatedly (85 models)

Update: Gabriel Weinberg is co-authoring a book about the mental models from this post. Get notified when the book comes out [here](https://upscri.be/6b02a1).

This is a great resource but I think it’s missing a table of contents for easier lookup thus:

## Physics

### [Critical Mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_mass) (2)

Flywheels have an inertia called the moment of inertia and thus resist changes in rotational speed.”)

### [Half-life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life) (2)

“Solving problems through an indirect and creative approach, using reasoning that is not immediately obvious and involving ideas that may not be obtainable by using only traditional step-by-step logic.”

### [Divergent Thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergent_thinking) vs [Convergent Thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_thinking) (1)

“Divergent thinking is a thought process or method used to generate creative ideas by exploring many possible solutions. It is often used in conjunction with its cognitive opposite, convergent thinking, which follows a particular set of logical steps to arrive at one solution, which in some cases is a ‘correct’ solution.” (related: [groupthink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink); [Maslow’s hammer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument) — “if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.”)

## Experimenting

### [Scientific Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method) (1)

“Systematic observation, measurement, and experiment, and the formulation, testing, and modification of hypotheses.” (related: [reproducibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility))

### [Proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_%28statistics%29) (1)

“A variable that is not in itself directly relevant, but that serves in place of an unobservable or immeasurable variable.
